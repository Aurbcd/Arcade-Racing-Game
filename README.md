## Presentation 
This project was developed in **Unity** by a team of four to prototype an arcade racing game in order to train on it, an agent with machine learning and transfer it to the other prototype we made, a [Realistic prototype](https://github.com/Machine-Learning-Transfert-Research/Realistic-Prototype).

## Setup
Warning: Make sure to have installed the python environment

### Start a training session
In [**Anaconda Prompt**](https://www.anaconda.com/download) or [**MiniForge Prompt**](https://conda-forge.org/download/)
1. Go to the project folder, then to the ```Assets/ML-Agents``` folder
2. Activate the python environment
```
conda activate mlagents
```
3. Start training *(replace XXX by the training number, e.g., 005)*
```
mlagents-learn Config/trainer_config.yaml --run-id=trainingXXX
```

In **Unity** 
1. Open the scenes ```Assets/scenes/Training```
2. Click on the **play** button

### Test trained agents
In **Unity** 
1. Open the scene ```Assets/scenes/Testing```
2. In the *Hierarchy* ```Car -> MovementRigibody``` GameObject
3. In the *Inspector* ```Behavior Parameters``` Script
4. Change the parameters ```Model``` with the neural network you want to test. Make sure that ```Behavior Type``` is set to *Inference Only*
5. **Launch** the scene

### Evaluate trained agent
In **Unity** 
1. Open the scenes ```Assets/scenes/Testing```
2. In the *Hierarchy* ```EnvTraining``` GameObject
3. In the *Inspector* ```Evaluation Tests``` Script
4. Set the parameters ```Model Tested``` with the neural network you want to evaluate
5. **Launch** the scene

## Technology
- Unity 6 *v6000.3.9f1*
- [ML Agents Plugin](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ml-agents@4.0/manual/index.html) *(version 4.0.2)*
